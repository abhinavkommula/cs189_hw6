Instructions:
No special instructions to run my python notebooks, although there may be 
a couple of python dependencies you will have to install depending on your
local environment. The Kaggle CNN model takes especially long to run on CPU, so 
if you're trying to run that to check consistency I would recommend requesting
access to CUDA.
